# A Better Calculator App.

Check it out [here](https://mackenziewritescode.github.io/calculator/).

As hinted in the project itself, this isn't your average calculator app. What makes this one different? First, let's consider how your average calculator works, like the one found on any iPhone.

After you've entered your first number, you follow it up with an operator (+, - ,* , /, =, etc.). That number is then stored as the first argument (Arg1), and the operator (Op) is stored as well. For this example, let's say the operator is "+". Up until this point, the display only shows Arg1.

Once you input a second number, the display clears to show you the second number (Arg2) as you input it. At this point enter another operator and a calculation happens: 
```
Arg1 + Arg2 = Answer
```


It might also be worth mentioning that this project is optomized for mobile use. Have a look for yourself!
